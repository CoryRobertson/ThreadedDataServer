# ThreadedDataServer
A java tool that has two components, a server, and a client. The client is able to connect once the server process is running, which allows the client to send messages in a clean format to the server.
### Uses
At the moment, I plan on implementing this project such that my rasperry pi is able to move servos based on the input given to this webserver.
